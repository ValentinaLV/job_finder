            <p> Jobs are posted on a large number of Ukrainian job search sites.
                But most actively and more fully, they are published only by a few.
                Every day, these sites are analyzed for new vacancies,
                according to requests from sub-subscribers -
                in which cities and what specialties to look for.
                All suitable vacancies that have been published on these sites over the past day,
                are recorded in the database and sent to subscribers according to their preferences.
                You can review current vacancies simply by selecting the necessary city and specialty.
                Or, after going through a simple <a href="{% url 'subscribers:subscribe_url' %}">
                subscribe form </a>, receive an e-mail every day with a list of new vacancies for the last day on your chosen specialty.
